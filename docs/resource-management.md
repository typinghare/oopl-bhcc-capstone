# Resourcer Management

## Foreword

Two months ago I downloaded Minecraft Java source code and tried to learn something from it. I was intrigued by the resource management system within it, and later I created my own version of it with TypeScript. I encapsulated it into a NPM package, and the source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/typinghare/ts-libs/tree/main/registry). I want to create a Python version this time.
